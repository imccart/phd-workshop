This website houses all of the info for a series of workshops in the Emory Economics PhD program. The goal of this series is to prepare everyone for the transition from a student to a professional researcher, whether that be in a university setting or the private field. We've split the content into general areas based on where a typical student is in a given year of the program.

- [**1st year workshop**](/year1/): just starting the program
- [**2nd year workshop**](/year2/): transitioning from the classroom to a researcher
- [**3rd year workshop**](/year3/): best practices in research
- [**4th year workshop**](/year4/): preparing for the market in the coming year
- [**5th year workshop**](/year5/): getting a job

Before you navigate to any specific workshop materials, please see our overall [**Etiquette**](/etiquette/) page. This is material for anyone/everyone. This is stuff that seems almost silly to mention, but academia tends to attract some interesting characters for which basic niceties and professional norms are sometimes lost. We want to avoid that type of label for anyone in our program.

I certainly didn't just sit down and write all of this stuff from scratch. All of this material benefited immensely from other resources. I'll try to list all of those resources here, although I'm sure I've missed something.
