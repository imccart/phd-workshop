But with a good foundation, you should find it easier to revisit old projects (e.g., after 6+ months waiting for reviews), identify promising new research, quickly filter out bad ideas, and write more compelling papers that (some) people actually want to read.\nThere are two central goals to the 3rd year workshop:\n1. Improve your workflow Understand some best practices for the research workflow, including strategies for collecting and organizing your ideas, replicability and version control, and backing up your work.\nThis is something that can save you a ton of time. With a good workflow, you can sort through ideas quickly and efficiently, organize literature reviews quickly, and keep track of what you’ve done (and what you want to do) for lots of projects. Most academics have wasted weeks of time due to bad workflow (myself included). Hopefully we can avoid some portion of this lost time for you.\n2. Become a better writer Most of us like to think of ourselves as good writers. Unfortunately most of us are probably wrong. As part of this workshop, we’ll share some general guidance on how to write an academic paper, including some ideas for a better “writing workflow” to ensure you’re writing as efficiently as possible.\n","date":1608422400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608422400,"objectID":"7e73b59faf3c8405df563c9524e9c69b","permalink":"/year3/goals/","publishdate":"2020-12-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/year3/goals/","section":"year3","summary":"The purpose of this 3rd year workshop is to share some of best practices and general advice with you, not for you to become a research robot. Every project is different, so there really isn’t a single best way to approach every project. But with a good foundation, you should find it easier to revisit old projects (e.g., after 6+ months waiting for reviews), identify promising new research, quickly filter out bad ideas, and write more compelling papers that (some) people actually want to read.","tags":null,"title":"What's the point?","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" The main goal of the 4th year workshop to help you sell yourself as best as possible on the job market. We’ll do this in three steps:\n1. Disseminating What are the best ways to get your work out there? How do conferences work? Should you write that op-ed that someone told you to write? Can (and how should) you use social media? We’ll offer some thoughts on all of these things. We’ll also help you get a decent (and free!) website together to make sure your work is easily accessible to anyone interested.\n2. Presenting Presenting your work in different venues can be tricky. How do you best prepare for a “long-form” presentation like an invited talk or a smaller conference? What about a larger conference with shorter presentation times? What about when you run into someone in the elevator who asks what you’re working on and you only have 30 seconds? We’ll talk about how best to prepare for all of these different situations. We’ll also talk about conference etiquette.\n3. Preparing for the job market Finally, let’s go through our checklist to ensure you have all of the required elements of a well-prepared job market candidate. Does your CV look professional? Is your website fully functional with the right types of links? Have you decided where you’d like to apply and prepared your committee accordingly? If you’re going on the academic market, have you prepared the non-research parts of your packet (a good syllabus and any other teaching material)?\n","date":1608422400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608422400,"objectID":"3961aefc00468dce84764f57d6fad0ac","permalink":"/year4/goals/","publishdate":"2020-12-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/year4/goals/","section":"year4","summary":"The main goal of the 4th year workshop to help you sell yourself as best as possible on the job market.
