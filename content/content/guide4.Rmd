This week we'll broaden our study of insurance purchasing to the market level and study how the presence of adverse selection can affect insurance markets and premiums.

### Objectives for this week
- Explain and draw graphically a simplified insurance market with adverse selection
- Calculate the insurer loss or profit at a given price
- Calculate the equilibrium price in the market under some assumptions on insurer profitability
- Solve for the subsidy amount or penalty amount that would ensure full insurance in a market
 

### Activities
- In-class problem on adverse selection. The worksheet is [here](/resource/wksheet3.html).
- Case study of New Jersey
