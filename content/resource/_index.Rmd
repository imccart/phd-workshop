Here we've assembled all of the external resources for the workshop. These are templates that you can use to get started with different documents.

- [Research template](https://github.com/imccart/research-template): This is a template for a basic directory structure and set of code files. This can be used in conjunction with the [example workflow in R](https://github.com/imccart/test-project) if writing the paper in R Markdown. If you're otherwise writing the paper outside of R, the research template will help initiate a standard folder/file structure for a new research project.
- [Example workflow in R](https://github.com/imccart/test-project): This is its own GitHub repo that assembles a hypothetical paper based on a built-in dataset within R. The main point of this example workflow is to ensure our research is easily reproducible (both to others and to our future selves). 
- [Example Academic Website](https://hollina.github.io/make-a-job-market-website.html): This is a guide to getting an academic website up and running with Hugo-Academic theme (now called [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/)), where Alex Hollingsworth provides some great advice. You can see his example site [here](https://job-candidate.netlify.app/) and the template repo [here](https://github.com/hollina/template-job-market-website).
- [CV templates](https://github.com/imccart/phd-workshop-template/tree/master/cv): A couple of examples from which you can get your own CV up and running.
- [Cover letter templates](https://github.com/imccart/phd-workshop-template/tree/master/cover-letter): You can use these templates for a cover letter for your job market applications as well your journal submissions.
