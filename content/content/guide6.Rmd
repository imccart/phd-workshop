This week we'll turn to physician treatment decisions. Just as asymmetric information between patients and insurance companies was a big part of the adverse selection problem, this module will show how asymmetric information between physicians and patients can also create some interesting dynamics and incentives.

### Objectives for this week

- Explain the principal-agent problem in the context of medical care
- Solve for treatment levels when physicians set prices and quantity
 

### Activities
- In-class problem on physician agency. The worksheet is [here](/resource/wksheet4.html).
