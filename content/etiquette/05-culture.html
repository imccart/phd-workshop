<p>An “office culture” is hard to define. It’s basically a system of values, shared assumptions, and group norms. I believe that strong, positive culture can help develop junior faculty, improve teaching, and even improve our research. There’s certainly plenty of evidence that a strong culture helps in a traditional office setting.</p>
