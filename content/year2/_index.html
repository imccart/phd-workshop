<p>In Year 2, you should begin the transition from student to researcher. You’re still taking some classes, but you need to also generate some research ideas. The purpose of this <strong>2nd year workshop</strong> is to share some of best practices and general advice to help you generate research ideas. This is not about how to really <strong>do</strong> the research (that’s what a PhD is for, after all!). This workshop is also not about workflow, replicability, or transparency in your research…that stuff is covered in the 3rd year workshop.</p>
