<h2>Slides</h2>
<p>The goal of this module is to answer the key questions that anyone should want answered when they start to learn something new, “what, why, who, and how?” (the “when” should be obvious…8:00am!! on Tu/Th) That is, “what are we learning and why?”, “who is learning it?”, and “how are we going to learn it?”</p>
<p>The module is divided into subsections aligning with these core questions, each with its own set of slides. Use the buttons below to open the slides either as an interactive website or as a static PDF (for printing or storing for later). You can also click in the embedded slides and navigate through them with your left and right arrow keys.</p>
<div class="fyi">
<p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: If you type <kbd>?</kbd> (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>) while going through the slides, you can see a list of special slide-specific commands.</p>

<div id="why" class="section level3">
<h3>01: Why?</h3>
<p>Why are you taking this class? What’s so interesting about health economics? Hopefully this part of our discussion convinces you how important and interesting health economics is.</p>

<h3>02: What?</h3>
<p>Let’s expand on the “why?” for a bit but also talk more specifically about the subjects we’ll cover in this class. This section is the “what?”.</p>

<h3>03: Who?</h3>
<p>A couple of activities to help us relax and build some class identity…</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>“Remember when…”</strong> I’ll type names in the chat box, and in that order, we’ll create our own improvised story. Each person will contribute a sentence to the story.</li>
<li><strong>“Where are we?”</strong> We’ll collect everyone’s latitude and longitude, take the average, and find out where the “center” of our class is. Here are the steps:
<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="latlong.net">latlong.net</a> to find your current latitude and longitude.</li>
<li>Go to our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qfdFm21lc7ouVliD66Je3jse9XkmqbpkM0C68oEGoXo/edit?usp=sharing">class latitude and longitude spreadsheet</a> to enter your latitude and longitude. It will automatically average our locations.</li>
<li>Once we’ve added all the information, we’ll discuss some fun facts about our class location.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
