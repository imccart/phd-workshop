In Year 2, you should begin the transition from student to researcher. You're still taking some classes, but you need to also generate some research ideas. The purpose of this **2nd year workshop** is to share some of best practices and general advice to help you generate research ideas. This is not about how to really **do** the research (that's what a PhD is for, after all!). This workshop is also not about workflow, replicability, or transparency in your research...that stuff is covered in the 3rd year workshop.
