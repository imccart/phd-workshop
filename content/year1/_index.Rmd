Congrats!! You're now officially an economics PhD student! If you're anything like I was, you're probably feeling a little stressed already...

The goal of this 1st year "workshop" is to help students understand what the 1st year of an economics PhD program is like and provide some tips for succeeding and thriving in the program.
