<p>But I think a lot about “being professional” can be summarized in three simple rules:</p>
<div class="fyi">
<p><strong>Rules of Etiquette</strong><br>
1. Give others the benefit of the doubt<br>
2. Always assume you made the mistake until proven otherwise<br>
3. Respect others’ time</p>
<p>“Others” means <strong>everyone</strong>, not just “other professors”</p>
</div>
<p>Follow the links to the left for some extra information in specific areas.</p>
