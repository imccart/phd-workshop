This week we begin our coverage of hospital pricing, starting with a setup in which hospitals can set prices in one market and must take a fixed price in another market. 

### Objectives for this week

- Use our two-price model to predict the effect of a change in public (e.g. Medicare or Medicaid) prices
- Identify the minimum price at which public insurance patients lose access to care
- Define cost-shifting and summarize the key aspects of the cost-shifting debate

### Activities

- Solve for the profit maximizing price and quantity for a monopolistically competitive firm. Worksheet available [here](/resource/wksheet7.html).
- Solve the practice problem on the two-price model. Worksheet available [here](/resource/wksheet8.html).
