<p>Here’s your roadmap for the semester!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/content/"><strong>Content</strong></a> (<i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i>): Links and information on readings, slides, and any pre-recorded lectures. I <strong>will not</strong> post any recordings of our live class sessions on the website. Those are available only on Canvas.</li>
<li><a href="/content/guide1/"><strong>Weekly Guide</strong></a> (<i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i>): Links to weekly (the classes don’t split perfectly into weekly sections, but I’ll call it weekly nonetheless) learning objectives and activities.</li>
<li><a href="/assignment/"><strong>Assignment</strong></a> (<i class="fas fa-pencil-ruler"></i>): Detailed information, instructions, and grading criteria for each assignment. <strong>Assignments are due by 11:59 PM on the day they’re listed.</strong></li>
</ul>
