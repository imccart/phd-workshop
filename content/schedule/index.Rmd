Here's your roadmap for the semester!

- [**Content**](/content/) (<i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i>): Links and information on readings, slides, and any pre-recorded lectures. I **will not** post any recordings of our live class sessions on the website. Those are available only on Canvas. 
- [**Weekly Guide**](/content/guide1/) (<i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i>): Links to weekly (the classes don't split perfectly into weekly sections, but I'll call it weekly nonetheless) learning objectives and activities.
- [**Assignment**](/assignment/) (<i class="fas fa-pencil-ruler"></i>): Detailed information, instructions, and grading criteria for each assignment. **Assignments are due by 11:59 PM on the day they're listed.**
