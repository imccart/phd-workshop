<p>Here we’ve assembled all of the external resources for the workshop. These are templates that you can use to get started with different documents.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/imccart/research-template">Research template</a>: This is a template for a basic directory structure and set of code files. This can be used in conjunction with the <a href="https://github.com/imccart/test-project">example workflow in R</a> if writing the paper in R Markdown. If you’re otherwise writing the paper outside of R, the research template will help initiate a standard folder/file structure for a new research project.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/imccart/test-project">Example workflow in R</a>: This is its own GitHub repo that assembles a hypothetical paper based on a built-in dataset within R. The main point of this example workflow is to ensure our research is easily reproducible (both to others and to our future selves).</li>
<li><a href="https://hollina.github.io/make-a-job-market-website.html">Example Academic Website</a>: This is a guide to getting an academic website up and running with Hugo-Academic theme (now called <a href="https://wowchemy.com/">Wowchemy</a>), where Alex Hollingsworth provides some great advice. You can see his example site <a href="https://job-candidate.netlify.app/">here</a> and the template repo <a href="https://github.com/hollina/template-job-market-website">here</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/imccart/phd-workshop-template/tree/master/cv">CV templates</a>: A couple of examples from which you can get your own CV up and running.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/imccart/phd-workshop-template/tree/master/cover-letter">Cover letter templates</a>: You can use these templates for a cover letter for your job market applications as well your journal submissions.</li>
</ul>
