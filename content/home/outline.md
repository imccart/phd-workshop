This website houses all of the info for a series of workshops in the Emory Economics PhD program. The goal of this series is to prepare everyone for the transition from a student to a professional researcher, whether that be in a university setting or the private field. We've split the content into three general areas based on where a typical student is in a given year of the program: the [**3rd year workshop**](/year3/) is for students who have finished their classes and are actively transitioning to full-time research; the [**4th year workshop**](/year4/) is for students preparing for the market in the coming year; and the [**5th year workshop**](/year5/) is solely about the job market and preparing for interviews. These are just labels we use to organize stuff...of course, plenty of students go on the market in their 6th year, and some even go on the market in their 4th year. 

Before you navigate to any specific workshop materials, please see our overall [**Etiquette**](/etiquette/) page. This is material for anyone/everyone. This is stuff that seems almost silly to mention, but academia tends to attract some interesting characters for which basic niceties and professional norms are sometimes lost. We want to avoid that type of label for anyone in our program.
