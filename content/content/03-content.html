<h2>Slides</h2>
<p>The goal of this module is to understand hospital pricing, how we measure competition (in general, but also some specific aspects of health care markets), and how competition affects hospital/insurer negotiations.</p>
<p>Use the buttons below to open the slides either as an interactive website or as a static PDF (for printing or storing for later). You can also click in the embedded slides and navigate through them with your left and right arrow keys.</p>
