<p>While there are many, many reasons that someone may not finish a PhD program, I think most of them can fit into one of three general areas:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Match with “PhD life”</li>
<li>Match with program</li>
<li>Allocation of effort</li>
</ol>
<p>In these slides, we’ll talk a bit more about these areas and what I think they mean.</p>
