We made it! This is our last week of new content. We'll finish this semester with a nice discussion of mergers and prices, interpreting this literature in the context of the negotiation model we've covered previously.

### Objectives for this week

- Summarize the existing data on hospital mergers and their effects on hospital prices and quality
- Differentiate between in- and out-of-market mergers
